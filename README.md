# Fullstack Challenge MOSANO
This challenge arises from a proposal of Mosano, a company specialized in software development. 
This project consists in the development of an API and a client with the purpose of simulating a functional prototype. 
The main objective is to ensure that communication occurs smoothly and easy interaction with the user. The graphical interface developed allows the registration of users through their full name, country and birthday. After entering and submitting these parameters, the data is sent to the API and documents are created in a database.

## Implementation
The API is developed in Node.js together with GraphQL. All querys and mutations responsible for manipulating the database documents are implemented according to the actions on the front-end. An authentication method is added in this application so that only users who are properly registered can access the system. Only after the correct insertion of the credentials will the user have the ability to insert new records, edit and delete.

### Installation 

1. Clone Repo `https://github.com/AMak77/MosanoChallenge/`
2. `cd MosanoChallenge` - Project directory
3. `npm install` - Install dependencies of back-end
4. `npm start` - Start back-end application
5. `cd frontend` - Client directory
6. `npm install` - Install dependencies of front-end
7. `npm start` - Start front-end application

### Result
* The user must be registered to access the system. However, the data entered can still be consulted.
